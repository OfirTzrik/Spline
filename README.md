# Spline
Simple project to get a refresher on C using raylib.
Add up to 20 points (movable) to form a spline.

TO-DO:
1. Add points by right clicking and remove points by left clicking.
2. Add reset button 
3. Rewrite some of the functions to improve performance. (WIP)
    - Currently does not drop below 60 FPS with over to 500 segments.
