# Spline
Simple project to get a refresher on C using raylib.
Add up to 20 points (movable) to form a spline.

TO-DO:
1. Move functions to a separate file.
2. Replace Circle struct with something simpler (using raylib's Vector2?).
3. Add points by right clicking and remove points by left clicking.
4. Add reset button 
5. Rewrite some of the functions to improve performance.
    - Currently does not drop below 144 FPS with up to 200 segments (on Intel i5-12600KF).
